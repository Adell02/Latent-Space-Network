# Initial Model: Latent Program Network

## Overview
The model is designed to process sequences and is built using a Transformer architecture. It consists of an encoder and a decoder, both of which are crucial for handling sequence-to-sequence tasks. The model is likely used for tasks involving sequence reconstruction or transformation, given the presence of sequence visualization utilities.

## Key Components

1. **Transformer Encoder**:
   - **Purpose**: Encodes the input sequence into a latent representation.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `input_dim`: Dimensionality of the input.
     - `hidden_dim`: Dimensionality of the hidden states.
     - `num_layers`: Number of layers in the encoder.
     - `num_heads`: Number of attention heads.
     - `dropout`: Dropout rate for regularization.
     - `max_length`: Maximum length of the input sequence.

2. **Transformer Decoder**:
   - **Purpose**: Decodes the latent representation back into a sequence.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `output_dim`: Dimensionality of the output.
     - `hidden_dim`, `num_layers`, `num_heads`, `dropout`: Similar to the encoder.

3. **Latent Program Network**:
   - **Purpose**: Integrates the encoder and decoder, managing the latent space.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `latent_dim`: Dimensionality of the latent space.
     - Other parameters are similar to those in the encoder and decoder.

4. **Training Settings**:
   - **Epochs**: 300
   - **Learning Rate**: 1e-4
   - **Batch Size**: 128
